# Data Transformation
I cleaned the data of unnecessary values and created a summarized sheet for death cases, confirmed cases and recovered cases all due to COVID for easy derivation of data insights/reports



---
# Findings and Recommendation
I found the top countries with the highest number of confirmed cases due to covid which also corresponds most time to an high number of deaths.
I would advise such countries to folllow the guildlines set by WHO to reduce the impact of COVID in their respective countries

# Note
Only the dashboard sheet was uploaded due to the large size of the initial due to this the filters arent fuctioning
